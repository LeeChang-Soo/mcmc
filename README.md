### `PyMC3` examples from [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis][site] and [ARM][arm]

##### Doing Bayesian Data Analysis

My attempt to morph Kruschke's excellent [MCMC examples][examples] from `R` over to `PyMC3`.

A lot of the code was borrowed from [Jordi Warmenhoven][jordi] and [Osvaldo Martin][osvaldo].

##### ARM Models

Translating [`Stan` models][arm] originally from Gelman and Hill's
[Data Analysis Using Regression Analysis and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models][gelman_hill]
book over to `PyMC3`.
